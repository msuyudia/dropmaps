# Note
For google maps api key, use your own API key which enables billing. Due to the security and size limits of my API key, I therefore replaced my API key with a text which is bound to fail when you build this application. Please put your API key in gradle.properties and in the values -> google_maps_api.xml folder. Or you can look up the text value for the google maps API key in a project called "<b>YOUR_API_KEY</b>"</br>
